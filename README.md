The chat messenger. You can see a chat application where two or more users can have a chat. On the left side, you can see when someone is typing and also you can see all current users in the chat. Moreover, on the right side where all conversation is going on you can see all your messages on the right and others on the left. In the center you can see an information when a user joins or lefts the chat. 
In my messager I used html/css, JavaScript, NodeJs, Socket.io,  bootstap.
You can find an intro page with links to the chat or page "about." On "about" page you can find an briefly information about me and short information about design. 

My favourite colour is purple,also I like black and pink. I was searching cpolours palletes and I comined two of them. I think these colours are look good with each other.
That way I`ve chose to built website in purple, pink, blue, black and darkred colours.

Challenges:
The most challenging for me was to understand how to show when a user is typing and to others, and one of my navbars didin`t work properly, but then I found a mistake, and now everything fine.
